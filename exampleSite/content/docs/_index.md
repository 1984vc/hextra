Welcome to the Hextra documentation!


## What is Hextra?

**Hextra** is a modern, responsive and powerful [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), inspired by Next.js theme [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra).
It is designed for building websites for documentation, blogs, books and landing pages.
It is elegant and easy to use out of the box, but also highly customizable to fit your needs.

### Features

- **Fast** - Built with Hugo and Tailwind CSS, Hextra is extremely fast.

## Why Hextra?

Hextra is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go, which means you can build your website once and host it anywhere.

Unlike Next.js, Hugo is **extremely fast**, which enables us to focus on iterating the content and previewing the changes in real time.
